I did this project to control the robot required for the Smart way project, where I was able to learn how to start building a robot and how to operate and control it, as a chat icon was added to talk with the robot and guide people to their destination,
 IBM Watson Assistant was used to make a web chat And add it to the robot control page.
 HTML, javascript and ccs were used to make the web page and json for chat programming. The codes were written in the Notepad++ editor.
